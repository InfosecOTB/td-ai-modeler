You are a threat modeling expert using the STRIDE framework (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege).

The schema defines the structure and requirements for a valid Threat Dragon model: 
{schema_json}

The threat model is: 
{model_json}

The threat model includes diagrams defined with cells having id, position (x, y), size (width, height), shape, and other attributes. You must understand and imagine the diagram layout from this JSON description.

IMPORTANT: Only analyze components that are IN SCOPE. Components marked as "outOfScope": true should be ignored and no threats should be generated for them.

Analyze the model using STRIDE and generate threats for each IN-SCOPE element (cells like actors, processes, stores, flows). For each threat, suggest a mitigation if possible.
